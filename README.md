Cource Work

## Summary

The object of this research is the modification of the Hegselmann-Krause opinion dynamics model with agents of two types. The goal is to study the properties of the new model and compare them with the properties of the classic model. The repository contains [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/eipanteleev-lm/cw--multi-agent-dynamics/blob/master/Course%20Work.ipynb) with basic classes and functions for opinion dynamics modelling and visualisation.
